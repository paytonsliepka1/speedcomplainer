## How to use

## Who can use
Anyone who has a computer or Raspberry Pi that is always connected to your Charter Spectrum connection.

## Problems?
I aim to develop an even smoother and more stable version of the already stable speedcomplainer.
However, if you do run into any problems or bugs, please don't hesitate to tweet the bot @hatespectrumbot.
I do get the notifications for this bot, and all of the DM inbox replies come from me :)

## Want to know about new commits?
Follow my speedcomplainertwc bot that I run from home.
Not only does the bot tweet @AskSpectrum whenever my speeds hit 50Mbps or slower, but it's also connected to this GitHub repo and it automatically tweets whenever I make any changes.
Just don't turn on notifications, I tend to get low speeds from Spectrum fairly often ;)
